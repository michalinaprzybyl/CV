# CV

My main goal was to learn HTML and CSS by creating a website with CV. My inspiration and help was the HTML and CSS marathon organized by GoIT. Thanks to this marathon and the classes at Software Development Academy, I learned the basics of HTML and CSS: how to use HTML tags, how to style a page with CSS, and how to create a responsive layout.
